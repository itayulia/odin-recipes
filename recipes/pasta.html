      <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon crushed garlic</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium
        heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper; add to the pan and cook 30
        seconds per side. Remove to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shallots to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook
        until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, lemon zest, and
        &frac12; of the lemon juice; heat for 2 minutes. Reserve remaining lemon
        juice for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cream and bring to a simmer. Return shrimp to the skillet and cook
        until heated through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add basil.
      </li>
      <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving &frac14; to &frac12; cup pasta water.</li>
      <li>
        Add spaghetti to the skillet. Add pasta water as needed and pepper
        flakes; toss to coat. Season with pepper if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
