    <p>
      This coffee-rubbed steak uses coffee grounds in a rub to create a deep,
      dark crust when seared, which enhances a steak's natural umami.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>&frac14; cup finely ground coffee</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons chili powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Hungarian sweet and spicy paprika</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>&frac14; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>4 filet mignon steaks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine coffee, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt,
        and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. Let steak come to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high. Pat steak dry with paper towels
        and season both sides generously with coffee rub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place steaks on the preheated grill. Close the lid and cook for 4 to 5
        minutes. Flip steaks and cook until an instant read thermometer inserted
        near the center reads 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C), 4 to 5
        minutes more, for medium-rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steak from the grill, tent with foil, and let it rest for a few
        minutes to allow juices to redistribute.
      </li>
    </ol>
